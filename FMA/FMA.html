		<p id="sum">In this world alchemists exist, people who study and perform the art of alchemical transmutation, the ability to manipulate objects and transform one object into another. They are bound by the basic law of alchemy: equivalent exchange. In order to obtain or create something, something of equal value must be lost or destroyed. The main character is the famous alchemist Edward Elric, also known as the Fullmetal Alchemist who almost lost his little brother, Alphonse, in an alchemical accident. Edward managed to attach his brother's soul to a large suit of armor. While he did manage to save his brother's life, he paid the terrible price of his limbs. To get back what they've lost, the brothers embark on a journey to find the Philosopher's Stone that is said to amplify the powers of an alchemist enormously. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a re-telling of the story that follows the original manga.</p>

				<p>Edward Elric is the protagonist of the Fullmetal Alchemist series. After losing his right arm and left leg due to a failed Human Transmutation attempt, Ed became the youngest State Alchemist in history by achieving his certification at age twelve. Three years later, Ed has become fully engrossed in his search for the legendary Philosopher's Stone, an item with which he hopes to restore his younger brother Alphonse - whose whole body had been lost in the aftermath of the human transmutation.</p>

				<p>Alphonse Elric, the younger brother of Edward Elric, is also a victim of the failed Human Transmutation experiment in which Ed lost his right arm and left leg. Having had his entire physical being taken away from him in the aftermath of the tragedy, Alphonse exists solely as a soul alchemically bound to a large suit of steel armor. Now, Al travels with his brother in search of a legendary Philosopher's Stone, an item with the power to restore their bodies to normal.</p>
