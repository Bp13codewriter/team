Things aren't looking good for the bewildered teenager, however not long after his arrival, he meets a mysterious beauty named Satella, in hot pursuit after the one who stole her insignia. Subaru offers to help in her search, and later that night, he even finds the whereabouts of that which she seeks. But just minutes after locating the insignia, Subaru and Satella are brutally murdered. However, Subaru immediately reawakens to a familiar scene; meeting Satella all over again.
